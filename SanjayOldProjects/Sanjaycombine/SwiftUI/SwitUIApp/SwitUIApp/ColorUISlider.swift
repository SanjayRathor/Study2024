//ColorUISlider wraps a UIView, not a UIViewController, so it conforms to UIViewRepresentable, not UIViewControllerRepresentable.
//The biggest difference between State and Binding is ownership. Views with property's marked with State have ownership. The system created storage on that specific views behalf. With property's marked with Binding, the view has read and write access, but not ownership.
